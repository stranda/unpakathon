#Three levels of experimental organization

Each experiment unpak conducts is given a different experiment name, '1a1'.  These can be nested within a meta.experiment name (such as '1' for the experiment above).  In addition it is possible to specify a block within each experiment.  This provides two levels of hierarchy in the experiments, though these levels might not always be treated the same.


```{r include=F}
library(igraph)
library(unpakathon)
```

```{r}
map=unique(phenolong[,c("experiment","meta.experiment")])
plot(graph_from_data_frame(map))
```
